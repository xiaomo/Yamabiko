Monocular Estimation of Spatial Displacement
============================================

This article investigates how cues in monocular vision can be explored to estimate a robot's position relative to a set of visible landmarks. It presents a model for reasoning about the problem, a data set recorded to test the model, provisional solutions for the problems of selecting and comparing landmarks on images, and a set of statistical results computed from those elements. The results point towards the feasibility of visual estimation of landmark-relative displacement from monocular images.
