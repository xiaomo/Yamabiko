# Yamabiko Symposium Submissions

The Yamabiko Symposium is organized three times a year by the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory of the University of Tsukuba. Laboratory students report the current state and latest achievements of their research plans. This repository stores the articles I presented during my 2013-2016 PhD course, along with presentation slides, source code and (when storage requirements permit) data used in my research.

Submissions are stored in folders in the format `(year)-(edition)`, with contents sorted in the following subfolders:

* `Article`: LaTeX sources for the submitted report, including any images used;
* `Code`: source code used in the research;
* `Data`: data files and scripts for drawing plots and the like;
* `Presentation`: slides for the article's presentation;
* `Presentation/Drafts`: earlier presentation drafts, kept as separate files to preserve whatever slides I had to discard due to time restrictions.

More details on my method for writing and managing symposium submissions are available [here](PROCESS.md). You are welcome to give it a try, or maybe take it as a basis for developing your own approach.
