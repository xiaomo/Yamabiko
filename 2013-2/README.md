Weightless Neural Networks for Depth Map Estimation
===================================================

ZETA is a Weightless Neural Network (WNN) for monocular depth map estimation. Weightless Neural Networks mirror an alternative view on how biological neurons work. As a machine learning tool, they are remarkable for both its simplicity and flexibility, being applicable to a wide range of classification problems. This article describes the class of Weightless Neurons used in ZETA -- known as Virtual Generalizing Random Access Memory (VG-RAM) neurons -- as well as the system's overall architecture. Its accuracy is reported, and directions for future improvements are discussed in the conclusion.
